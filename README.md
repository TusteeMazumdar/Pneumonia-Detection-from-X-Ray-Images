# Pneumonia-Detection-from-X-Ray-Images
This project aims to help detect Pneumonia from X-ray images using Transfer Learning with the VGG16 model. By fine-tuning a pre-trained model and applying data augmentation, it accurately classifies X-ray images as either normal or showing signs of pneumonia.
